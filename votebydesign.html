          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Assessing User Experience Through Need-finding and Iteration
          </h2>
          <p class="lead">After the first workshop of Vote by Design was organized at the Stanford d.school, we were left with a lot of questions. Should/can the workshop be shorter? How can we design the workshop for different audience sizes? How
            can we have a meaningful and constructive non-partisan conversation about politics? What can the facilitation team do to keep audience engagement high throughout the workshop?
            To explore these questions, we decided to prototype Vote by Design with multiple audiences that varied in size, demographic, and even political opinion. We would go into an event with a hypothesis we wanted to test, and after the event
            debrief to asses how the audience reacted to the elements of the workshop.

          <p class="lead">After thoroughly testing the pilot and iterating the facilitation guide, we hosted our first Vote by Design public workshop in partnership with HanaHaus Palo Alto. It was the first time piloting the event with more than 30
            people at once. Given we had more than 80 participants registered, we on-boarded volunteers to help with logistics and flow of the workshop.

          <p class="lead">Shortly after had refined every detail of the event, the US government started implementing shelter-in-place policies due to COVID-19. The next part of our challenge was to transfer the learning experiences from the original
            workshop into a digital one.
            Our first action item was researching online platforms that would allow us to fully digitalize all aspects of the workshop. After consulting designers and people in the industry, we came across NearPod and hosted a demo with their product
            team.
            We developed our first online prototype with a NearPod educator license and started running our initial user testing via Zoom.
