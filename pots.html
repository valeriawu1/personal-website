          <p class="lead">The first 14 months of the project were dedicated to researching viable solutions that could offset the need for a gas heater. Given the little background we had on renewable energy technology when the project began, a lot
            of our research included speaking to university professors, industry experts, and even the school’s janitors to understand how the heating system was maintained. We initially considered all types of solutions, ranging from a biogas plant
            to a tank of water painted in black to attract more heat.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">After performing considerable amounts of research, we choose to work with solar energy since the amount of solar radiation Lima receives annually was found to be remarkably high.

          <p class="lead">Our first intuition was solar panels, but it was technically complicated to transform the type of energy that solar panels produced into heat. After more research, we eventually determined that solar water heaters were the
            perfect fit. Although solar technology companies in Peru are quite limited, we spent considerable amounts of time meeting with providers and looking at their proposals.

          </p>
          <p class="lead">Considering that I was 13 years old at the time and my co-lead was 16, it was very challenging for us to assess both the technology and finances being proposed to us by companies. Our mentor was key in guiding us to asking
            the right questions to determine what was differentiated a good and great proposal.

          </h2>
          <p class="lead">Given that it was the first student-led installation in the school’s history, the Board of Directors were very hesitant to give us funding for the project. That’s how we started applying to different renewable energy grants
            within Peru and also internationally.

          </p>
          <p class="lead">In 2013, we were nominated Finalists of the Americas for the Zayed Future Energy Prize (ZFEP), a prize based in the UAE that rewards achievements that furthered the global proliferation of impactful sustainability solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">We were invited to the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2014, and awarded a cash prize of $50,000 USD from her Highness Shaikha Fatima bint Mubarak to implement our project proposal.

          <p class="lead">Despite having the money, a provider, and all the technical details nailed, the Board of Directors and the pool manager were still very apprehensive for the installation.

          </p>
          <p class="lead">Determined to get an approval, we requested a slot in the annual Board of Directors meeting, where we invited every stakeholder in school that would be impacted by the project, and explained the project from start to finish.
            Shortly after the meeting, we got a green light from the administration for the installation. The installation achieved savings of $30,000/yr and 75MtC02/yr.
