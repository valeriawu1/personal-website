          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Scoping the Problem
          </h3>
          <p class="lead">Changing the world was a sexy but abstract concept for 10-year old Valeria. I never thought I could do something about the real problems around me. Then, at age 11, I attended a Global Issues Network Conference, a place
            where young minds come together to propose solutions to global issues. There, I realized that students could change the world when given the right tools. At 12 and 13, I presented my own GIN project in Costa Rica and Mexico and felt
            energized by working with like-minded students. At 14, I began wondering: How could others unable to afford traveling to the conference still experience this connection?

          </p>
          <p class="lead">It became clear that the barrier to problem-solving wasn’t a lack of solutions but a lack of contact among those with innovative ideas. That's why, at 15, I founded the GIN Global Ambassadors Program (GAP) to ensure that
            other students with drive could find each other to share experiences and skills.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">I wanted GAP to be a cost-free virtual space to guide GIN students through the process of developing solutions that impact their communities. As Program Director, my focus was to develop practical learning tools and
            curriculum documents so we could work with Ambassadors through Skype sessions and research projects.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Developing Student Curriculum</h2>
          <p class="lead">After launching GAP, I struggled like a mother with her first child. The question I sought to answer as a sophomore is still the one I ask myself today: What should a curriculum that meets the learning needs of students from
            30+ nationalities look like? On the one hand, I had Celine, who was always demanding more projects because her school in Vietnam was extremely supportive, and on the other, I had Vicky, who couldn’t complete all of the courses because her
            school had been shut down by the authoritarian Venezuelan regime! I also had to find ways to empower students from across the world, who had never met in person, to commit to a two-year program.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Prototyping Solutions
          </h2>
          <p class="lead">My team and I began prototyping solutions. We split the curriculum into smaller courses and divided our Ambassadors into smaller cohorts, challenging them with group projects according to their interests. These changes helped students like Celine and Vicky choose the courses most relevant to their specific projects. It also enabled Juan and Yeon to successfully pitch GAP at a 400-person GIN Conference in Panama, despite not having met until the day of the presentation. Things were coming together, but I wasn’t fully satisfied.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Bringing The Program Together</h2>

          <p class="lead">If I truly wanted to bring connection to the problem-solving process, I needed to foster meaningful relationships between the Ambassadors and myself. This realization changed my perspective about leadership. I stopped trying to live up to my “Program Director” title and instead made a conscious effort to focus on each Ambassador’s project and well-being. I knew I was achieving my goal when Maria Laura texted me at 11pm from Bolivia asking me to help her choose between two universities. I knew it again when Roopal from Singapore asked me for feedback on an article he was hoping to publish. These stories--among many others--show how my program provides the structure for deeper relationships to flourish.
